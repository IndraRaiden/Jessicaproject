        <p class="quote">I've worked with Jessica for almost 3 years at IHG where she was a joy to work with, not only because of her positive attitude, but also because of her exceptional design sensibility and the passion she brings to all aspects of her work. At one point we shared the FF&E/Architectural design responsibilities of at least 5 large projects that were high touch and all different stages of design. We both had to manage clients and attend meetings both internally and externally, while manage drawing sets, purchasing, agenda, vendors, clients, consultants, and design presentations. Jessica was always willing to jump in and help in any way she could. She was able to consistently contribute to design with thoughtful and creative solutions. Through our time working together, I saw that she has many strengths in all aspects of the design process, from concept to completion. She is also very strong while dealing with clients, both in person and via email. She knows the importance of managing expectations, while also presenting herself very professionally for client facing meetings. I cannot recommend her enough as a colleague and design lead for projects.</p>
